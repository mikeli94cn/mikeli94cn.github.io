# How to Learn Computer Graphics Systematically

Computer graphics is a large field because it sits at the intersection of:

```text
Mathematics
    |
    +-- Linear Algebra
    +-- Geometry
    +-- Calculus

Computer Science
    |
    +-- Algorithms
    +-- Data Structures
    +-- Programming

Computer Hardware
    |
    +-- CPU
    +-- GPU

Given your previous learning path (**computer systems → software engineering → GUI → OOP → Java**), a particularly strong route would be:

**JavaFX Canvas → 2D graphics algorithms → linear algebra → OpenGL → GPU shaders → graphics engine design**

This path will also explain *why GUI works internally*, because GUI frameworks are essentially **specialized computer graphics systems with event handling added on top**.
