# what is file system?
A **file system** is the method an operating system uses to **organize, store, retrieve, and manage files and folders** on a storage device such as a hard drive, SSD, USB drive, or memory card.

Think of it like a library:

* **Storage device** = the library building
* **Folders (directories)** = shelves
* **Files** = books
* **File system** = the cataloging system that keeps track of where every book belongs

### What a file system does

* Organizes files into folders.
* Stores information about files, such as:

  * File name
  * Size
  * Creation and modification dates
  * Permissions (who can read or edit the file)
* Keeps track of where each file is physically stored on the disk.
* Allows users and programs to create, open, edit, copy, move, and delete files.

### Common file systems

* **NTFS** – Used by Windows.
* **FAT32** – Older file system, compatible with many devices.
* **exFAT** – Common for USB drives and SD cards, supports large files.
* **APFS** – Used by modern macOS.
* **ext4** – Commonly used by Linux.

### Example

Suppose you save a document:

```
Documents/
    Homework/
        science_project.docx
```

The file system records:

* The folder structure (`Documents → Homework`)
* The file name (`science_project.docx`)
* Where the file is stored on the disk
* Its size, permissions, and other details

Without a file system, the computer would not know where files are stored or how to find them efficiently.

# History of File Systems

The history of file systems is closely connected to the history of **computers, storage devices, and operating systems**. File systems evolved because computers changed from simple machines that processed data sequentially into complex systems that store billions of files for many users and applications.

The main evolution can be understood as:

**No file system → Simple sequential storage → Hierarchical file systems → Database-like modern file systems → Distributed and cloud file systems**

---

# 1. Before File Systems (1940s–1950s): No Real File System

The earliest computers did not have file systems.

Examples:

* ENIAC (1945)
* Early mainframe computers

Programs and data were stored on:

* Punch cards
* Magnetic tape
* Drum memory

The programmer had to manually manage storage.

For example:

```
Tape:
Block 1: Program
Block 2: Input data
Block 3: Output data
```

The computer had no concept of:

* Files
* Folders
* Names
* Permissions

The programmer needed to know exactly where data was located.

### Problem

Storage became difficult as programs and data increased.

A new abstraction was needed:

> "Let the operating system manage storage, so programmers can think in terms of files."

This created the idea of the **file system**.

---

# 2. Early File Systems (1950s–1960s): Sequential Files

The first file systems appeared in early mainframe operating systems.

Examples:

* IBM mainframe systems
* Early UNIX predecessors

Storage devices:

* Magnetic tape
* Magnetic disks

The basic idea:

```
Disk

+---------+
| File A  |
+---------+
| File B  |
+---------+
| File C  |
+---------+
```

A file was simply a named collection of data blocks.

The operating system maintained a table:

```
Filename     Location

A.txt        Block 100-120
B.txt        Block 121-150
C.txt        Block 151-200
```

This introduced:

* File names
* File allocation
* File opening and closing

---

# 3. Disk File Systems (1960s–1970s)

The invention of reliable hard disks changed everything.

A disk allowed:

* Random access
* Faster searching
* Multiple files

File systems became more sophisticated.

Important ideas appeared:

## 3.1 File Allocation

The system needed to answer:

> Where are the pieces of this file stored?

Example:

```
File A

Block 10
Block 11
Block 12
Block 50
```

The file system maintains a map:

```
File A → 10,11,12,50
```

---

## 3.2 Directory Structure

Early systems often had one directory:

```
/
 ├── program1
 ├── program2
 └── data1
```

But this became too crowded.

So hierarchical directories appeared:

```
/
├── users
│   ├── alice
│   │   └── report.txt
│   └── bob
│       └── code.c
```

This idea became the foundation of modern file systems.

---

# 4. UNIX File System (1969–1970s): A Major Turning Point

The UNIX operating system introduced a very influential file system design.

Created at Bell Labs:

Bell Labs

UNIX introduced several concepts that still exist today.

---

## 4.1 Everything is a File

UNIX treated many things as files:

```
Regular file
    |
Directory
    |
Device
    |
Pipe
    |
Socket
```

For example:

```
/dev/sda
```

represents a disk device.

This simplified programming:

A program can use the same operations:

```
open()
read()
write()
close()
```

for many different resources.

---

## 4.2 Inode

UNIX introduced the idea of an **inode**.

A file name does not directly point to data.

Instead:

```
filename
    |
    v
 inode
    |
    v
 disk blocks
```

The inode stores:

* File size
* Permissions
* Owner
* Time information
* Disk block locations

Example:

```
hello.c

    |
    v

inode 12345

    |
    +---- block 500
    +---- block 501
    +---- block 502
```

This became one of the most important file system ideas.

---

# 5. FAT File System (1977–1980s)

Personal computers created a new requirement:

> A simple file system for small computers.

Microsoft introduced:

Microsoft

the FAT (File Allocation Table) system.

Used by:

* MS-DOS
* Early Windows
* Floppy disks
* USB drives

The structure:

```
Directory

   |
   v

FAT table

   |
   v

Data blocks
```

Example:

```
FILE.TXT

Block 5
 |
 v
Block 6
 |
 v
Block 7
```

Advantages:

* Simple
* Small
* Portable

Disadvantages:

* Poor security
* Limited file size
* Fragmentation problems

---

# 6. Windows File Systems (1980s–Today)

## 6.1 FAT32

Introduced in 1996.

Advantages:

* Compatible
* Simple

Problems:

* Maximum file size about 4GB
* No advanced security

---

## 6.2 NTFS (1993–Today)

Windows introduced:

NTFS

NTFS was designed for professional operating systems.

It added:

### Journaling

Before changing data:

```
Write intention

↓

Modify data

↓

Complete operation
```

If power fails:

The system can recover.

---

### Permissions

Example:

```
Alice:
    read/write

Bob:
    read only
```

---

### Metadata

NTFS stores rich information:

```
File

+
├── name
├── owner
├── permissions
├── timestamps
└── attributes
```

---

# 7. Linux File Systems (1990s–Today)

Linux inherited UNIX ideas.

Early Linux used:

```
ext
```

Then:

```
ext2
```

Later:

```
ext3
```

Added journaling.

Modern Linux commonly uses:

```
ext4
```

Features:

* Large files
* Journaling
* Better performance
* Efficient allocation

Other Linux file systems include:

## XFS

Designed for:

* Large servers
* Huge files

## Btrfs

Designed for:

* Snapshots
* Data integrity
* Modern storage

---

# 8. Modern Storage Era (2000s–Today)

Storage changed dramatically:

## From:

```
Hard disks
    |
Mechanical movement
```

## To:

```
SSD
    |
Flash memory
```

Traditional file systems were designed for disks.

SSDs required new techniques.

---

# 9. Apple File Systems

Apple created:

APFS

for modern devices.

Designed for:

* SSDs
* Encryption
* Mobile devices

Features:

## Copy-on-write

Instead of:

```
Modify old data
```

do:

```
Create new version
       |
       v
Replace pointer
```

Benefits:

* Faster snapshots
* Better reliability

---

# 10. Distributed File Systems (1990s–Today)

The internet created a new problem:

> What if files are larger than one computer?

The answer:

Distributed file systems.

Example:

Google File System

Architecture:

```
Computer A
    |
Computer B
    |
Computer C
    |
Computer D
```

A file may be divided:

```
Large File

Part 1 → Server A
Part 2 → Server B
Part 3 → Server C
```

Used in:

* Cloud computing
* Big data
* Data centers

---

# 11. Cloud File Systems (2010s–Today)

Modern applications often hide physical storage completely.

Examples:

* Cloud drives
* Object storage
* Distributed databases

The user sees:

```
myfile.txt
```

but internally:

```
User
 |
Internet
 |
API
 |
Storage cluster
 |
Thousands of disks
```

# The Big Idea Behind File System Evolution

The history of file systems is the history of solving increasingly difficult questions:

### 1. Where is my data?

→ File allocation

### 2. How do I organize millions of files?

→ Directories

### 3. How do many users share data safely?

→ Permissions

### 4. How do we survive crashes?

→ Journaling

### 5. How do we store petabytes of data?

→ Distributed file systems

### 6. How do we manage billions of devices?

→ Cloud and object storage

So the fundamental evolution is:

**A file system started as a simple map from names to disk blocks, and evolved into a complex data management system that provides organization, security, reliability, and scalability.**

# The Underlying Principle of File Systems

The fundamental principle of a file system is:

> **A file system is an abstraction layer that converts raw storage devices (blocks of bytes) into a logical, organized, reliable, and secure way of storing and accessing data.**

In other words:

```
Applications
      |
      v
Files and Directories  ← Human-friendly abstraction
      |
      v
File System            ← Management layer
      |
      v
Blocks on Storage      ← Physical reality
      |
      v
Disk / SSD Hardware
```

A program does not want to think:

> "Write bytes to sector 105234 on this SSD."

It wants to think:

> "Open report.txt and write my data."

The file system bridges this gap.

---

# 1. The Core Problem: Storage Is Just Raw Blocks

At the hardware level, a disk is extremely simple.

A storage device provides:

```
Block 0
Block 1
Block 2
Block 3
...
Block N
```

Each block contains bytes:

```
Block 100:
0101010101010101...

Block 101:
1101010101010101...
```

The disk does not know:

* What is a file
* What is a folder
* What is a picture
* Who owns the data

It only knows:

> "Read or write block number X."

---

# 2. File System Creates a Human Abstraction

The file system creates concepts:

```
Physical world:

Block 500
Block 501
Block 900
Block 901


Logical world:

photo.jpg
```

The file system maintains the mapping:

```
photo.jpg
      |
      v
Blocks:
500,501,900,901
```

This is the first fundamental principle:

## Principle 1:

## Names are separated from physical locations

A file name does not equal its storage location.

Example:

```
/home/mike/photo.jpg
```

does not mean:

```
Disk location:
Cylinder 500
Sector 20
```

The file system translates:

```
Name
 |
 v
Metadata
 |
 v
Physical blocks
```

---

# 3. Metadata: The File System's Brain

A file is more than data.

Example:

```
hello.txt
```

The system also needs:

```
Name:
hello.txt

Size:
10 KB

Owner:
Mike

Permissions:
read/write

Created:
2026-01-01

Location:
Blocks 1000-1005
```

This information is called:

**metadata**

The file system manages two kinds of data:

```
File data:
    "Hello World"


Metadata:
    name
    size
    owner
    location
```

---

# 4. File Allocation: Managing Space

The file system must answer:

> Where should a new file be stored?

Suppose a disk has:

```
Block:

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Free:
X X   X X X
```

A new file needs 3 blocks.

The file system decides:

```
file A

Block 3
Block 4
Block 7
```

Different file systems use different strategies.

---

## Contiguous Allocation

Store files together:

```
File A:

100
101
102
103
```

Advantages:

* Fast

Problems:

* Fragmentation

---

## Linked Allocation

Each block points to the next:

```
100 → 300 → 500 → 700
```

Advantages:

* Easy growth

Problems:

* Slow random access

---

## Indexed Allocation

Use an index:

```
inode

 |
 +-- block 100
 +-- block 300
 +-- block 500
```

Used by UNIX/Linux.

---

# 5. Directory: Organizing Names

A directory is actually a special file.

Example:

```
/home/mike/

----------------
name       inode

a.txt      1234
b.jpg      5678
code.c     9012
```

The directory maps:

```
filename
    |
    v
file metadata
```

Example:

```
report.docx
      |
      v
inode 2000
      |
      v
disk blocks
```

---

# 6. Access Control: Protecting Data

A file system also controls access.

Example:

```
file.txt

Owner:
Mike

Permissions:

Mike:
read/write

Others:
read only
```

The operating system checks:

```
Program requests:

open(secret.txt)

        |
        v

File system:

Does this user have permission?

        |
        v

Allow or deny
```

---

# 7. Reliability: Handling Failure

Storage devices fail.

Examples:

* Power loss
* System crash
* Bad sectors

Problem:

Imagine:

```
Step 1:
Create file entry

Step 2:
Write data blocks

Power failure happens
```

Now:

```
Directory says:
file exists

But data is missing
```

The file system needs consistency mechanisms.

---

## Journaling

Modern file systems use journals.

Before changing data:

```
Journal:

"I will create file A"
```

Then:

```
Perform operation
```

If failure occurs:

```
Read journal

Complete unfinished operation
```

Examples:

* NTFS
* ext4

---

# 8. Caching: Improving Speed

Disk access is slow.

So operating systems use memory:

```
Application

     |
     v

RAM cache

     |
     v

Disk
```

Example:

You open:

```
large_file.txt
```

The system keeps it in RAM.

Next access:

```
RAM → faster
```

---

# 9. Abstraction: The Most Important Principle

The deepest idea of a file system is **abstraction**.

Without a file system:

```
Application

"Write bytes to sector 235234"
```

With a file system:

```
Application

"Save document.txt"
```

The file system hides:

* Disk geometry
* Block allocation
* Hardware differences
* Error handling

---

# 10. Relationship with the Operating System

A file system is part of the OS kernel.

The relationship:

```
User Program
      |
      |
System Calls
(open, read, write)
      |
      v
File System
      |
      v
Block Device Driver
      |
      v
Disk Controller
      |
      v
Storage Hardware
```

Example:

A program calls:

```c
open("hello.txt");
```

The OS:

1. Finds the directory
2. Finds file metadata
3. Checks permissions
4. Finds disk blocks
5. Loads data into memory
6. Returns a file handle

---

# 11. The Five Fundamental Principles

A modern file system is built on five major ideas:

| Principle                | Purpose                          |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Abstraction              | Hide physical storage complexity |
| Naming                   | Give data meaningful identities  |
| Metadata                 | Describe and manage files        |
| Allocation               | Map files to storage blocks      |
| Protection & Reliability | Keep data safe                   |

---

# The Big Picture

A file system is essentially a **translator and manager**:

```
Human concept:

"My photo.jpg"


        ↓


File System


        ↓


Metadata:

photo.jpg
owner
permissions
size


        ↓


Physical storage:

Block 500
Block 501
Block 502
```

The deepest principle is:

> **A file system transforms unreliable, anonymous blocks of storage into a reliable, structured, secure information space that humans and programs can use.**

This principle is why file systems are one of the most important layers of an operating system.

# How Does a File System Work Internally?

Internally, a file system is a **data structure and algorithm system that manages the relationship between logical files and physical storage blocks**.

At the highest level:

```
Application
     |
     |  open("hello.txt")
     |
     v
Operating System
     |
     v
File System
     |
     v
Block Device Layer
     |
     v
SSD / HDD
```

The file system performs several jobs:

1. Translate file names into physical locations
2. Allocate storage space
3. Store file metadata
4. Manage directories
5. Control access permissions
6. Maintain consistency after crashes

Let's go step by step.

---

# 1. The Physical Storage Model

A disk is just a large array of blocks.

Example:

```
Disk

Block 0
Block 1
Block 2
Block 3
...
Block 999999
```

A block is usually:

```
4 KB
```

The disk only understands:

```
Read block 12345
Write block 67890
```

It does not understand:

```
open("photo.jpg")
```

The file system creates this higher-level model.

---

# 2. Disk Organization: The File System Layout

When a disk is formatted, the file system creates a structure.

A simplified layout:

```
+----------------+
| Boot Area      |
+----------------+
| Superblock     |
+----------------+
| Metadata Area  |
+----------------+
| Directory Data |
+----------------+
| File Data      |
+----------------+
```

Different file systems have different names:

Linux ext4:

```
Superblock
Block Groups
Inodes
Data Blocks
```

NTFS:

```
Master File Table (MFT)
Data Blocks
```

---

# 3. Superblock: The File System's Description

The first important structure is the **superblock**.

It describes the file system itself.

Example:

```
Superblock

File system:
    ext4

Total blocks:
    1,000,000

Free blocks:
    300,000

Block size:
    4096 bytes

Root directory:
    inode 2
```

The operating system reads this first.

It tells the OS:

> "How is this storage organized?"

---

# 4. File Metadata: The Inode Concept

A file usually has two parts:

```
File name
    |
    v
Metadata structure
    |
    v
Actual data blocks
```

In UNIX/Linux, the metadata structure is called an **inode**.

Example:

Directory:

```
home/
 |
 +-- hello.txt
```

Directory entry:

```
hello.txt → inode 100
```

inode:

```
inode 100

File size:
12 KB

Owner:
Mike

Permissions:
rw-r--r--

Data blocks:
500
501
502
```

Actual data:

```
Block 500:
Hello

Block 501:
World
```

So the path is:

```
hello.txt
     |
     v
inode 100
     |
     v
blocks 500,501,502
```

---

# 5. Opening a File Internally

Suppose a program executes:

```c
fd = open("hello.txt");
```

The internal process:

---

## Step 1: Parse the path

The OS receives:

```
/home/mike/hello.txt
```

It starts from the root directory:

```
/
 |
 +-- home
      |
      +-- mike
            |
            +-- hello.txt
```

---

## Step 2: Search directories

The file system looks inside directory structures.

Example:

```
Directory table:

Name          inode

home          10
mike          20
hello.txt     50
```

It finds:

```
hello.txt → inode 50
```

---

## Step 3: Load inode

The OS reads:

```
inode 50
```

It learns:

```
File size:
20 KB

Data blocks:
800
801
802
803
804
```

---

## Step 4: Create a file descriptor

The OS creates a handle:

```
Process

File Descriptor Table

0 → stdin
1 → stdout
2 → stderr
3 → hello.txt
```

The program receives:

```
fd = 3
```

The program does not know about blocks.

---

# 6. Reading a File

Program:

```c
read(fd, buffer, 4096);
```

Internally:

```
Application
      |
      v
System call
      |
      v
File system
      |
      v
inode lookup
      |
      v
Find block number
      |
      v
Disk read
      |
      v
Return bytes
```

Example:

inode:

```
hello.txt

blocks:
500
501
502
```

The file system requests:

```
Read block 500
```

The disk returns:

```
Hello World
```

---

# 7. Writing a File

Suppose:

```c
write(fd, "ABC");
```

The file system must:

## 1. Find free blocks

Example:

```
Free block bitmap:

100 101 102 103

free free used free
```

Choose:

```
block 100
```

---

## 2. Write data

```
Block 100:

ABC
```

---

## 3. Update metadata

Update inode:

Before:

```
size:
1000 bytes
```

After:

```
size:
1003 bytes
```

---

# 8. Free Space Management

The file system needs to know:

> Which blocks are available?

A common method:

## Bitmap

Example:

```
Block:

0 1 2 3 4 5

Bitmap:

1 1 0 1 0 0
```

Meaning:

```
1 = used
0 = free
```

So:

```
Block 2
Block 4
Block 5
```

are available.

---

# 9. Directory Internals

A directory is usually a special file.

Example:

```
/home/mike
```

contains:

```
Directory data:

name          inode

file1.txt     100
photo.jpg     200
code.c        300
```

When you type:

```
ls
```

the system:

1. Opens directory file
2. Reads entries
3. Displays names

# 10. Fragmentation

A file may not be stored continuously.

Example:

Ideal:

```
File A

100
101
102
103
```

But after many changes:

```
File A

100
500
900
1200
```

This is fragmentation.

The file system must track these pieces.

# 11. Journaling: Protecting Against Crashes

Problem:

Imagine:

```
Create file:

Step 1:
Create directory entry

Step 2:
Allocate blocks

Step 3:
Write data
```

Power failure happens after step 1.

Now:

```
Directory says:
file exists

But data does not exist
```

Solution: journal.

Before changing:

```
Journal:

"I will create file A"
```

Then:

```
Perform operation
```

After success:

```
Remove journal entry
```

After crash:

```
Replay unfinished operations
```

# 12. Caching: Making It Fast

Reading the disk repeatedly is slow.

So the OS keeps frequently used data in RAM:

```
             RAM

        +------------+
        | File cache |
        +------------+

              |
              v

            Disk
```

Example:

First read:

```
Disk → RAM
```

Second read:

```
RAM → Application
```

Much faster.

# 13. Modern File Systems Add More Features

Modern file systems include:

## Copy-on-write

Used by:

* APFS
* Btrfs

Instead of modifying:

```
Old data
```

they create:

```
New data copy
```

Benefits:

* Snapshots
* Crash safety

---

## Encryption

Example:

```
File data

   |
   v

Encrypted blocks

   |
   v

Disk
```

---

## Compression

Instead of:

```
AAAAAA
```

store:

```
A × 6
```

Saving space.

# The Core Idea

Internally, a file system is mainly a **mapping engine**:

```
Human view:

/home/mike/photo.jpg


        ↓


File System


        ↓


Metadata:

inode 500


        ↓


Physical storage:

blocks 1000
1001
1002
```

The deepest principle is:

> **A file system turns a flat array of storage blocks into a structured world of named files, directories, permissions, and reliable data.**

Understanding file systems is essentially understanding how operating systems transform **physical hardware resources into usable abstractions for programmers and users**.

# How to Learn File Systems Systematically

To learn file systems deeply, you should study them from **hardware → operating system → file system design → implementation → advanced distributed storage**.

A good learning path is:

# Good Books

## Beginner → Intermediate

**Operating System Concepts**
(usually called "The Dinosaur Book")

Focus on:

* File system interface
* File system implementation

## Intermediate → Advanced

**Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP)**

Especially chapters:

* File Systems
* File System Implementation
* Crash Consistency

## Advanced

**The Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD Operating System**

Good for real-world design.

---

# The Most Important Mental Model

Do not think:

> "A file system is just folders and files."

Think:

```
Raw storage blocks

        ↓

Metadata structures

        ↓

Mapping algorithms

        ↓

File abstraction

        ↓

Reliable storage service
```

The deepest understanding comes when you can answer:

1. **How does `open("a.txt")` find the data?**
2. **How does the system know where free space exists?**
3. **How does it recover after a crash?**
4. **How can millions of files be managed efficiently?**
5. **How does the design change for SSDs and distributed storage?**

Once you can answer these questions, you understand file systems at an operating-system level.
